# hydra-cca
Repository for the CCA flash-talk on 17th November 2024

CCA stands for [Creative Coding Amsterdam (cca.codes)](https://cca.codes), a meetup organized by @Stanko, @msawired and myself, where we get together to talk about all things art, technology and everything in between.

Last June I hade the luck to be able to attend a great and inspiring [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz) workshop by Saskia Freeke @sasj, which got under my skin a bit. With this quick introduction I want to pass on the (little) hydra knowledge I've gathered myself in the mean time, and who know maybe pass on the hydra-bug...

## Working constraints
- Stick to vanilla web tech stack: HTML, CSS, JS
- plus Hydra of course
